# Limbs Cyberpunk

This is an Android game that I abandoned many years ago, which I'm revisiting soon as a C++ project in SDL2. I retrieved these files from my original repo for reference as I begin to rebuild it as a desktop app. I might also port it to mobile, but that's not the priority.

Unpolished, but the basic functionality is clear. All will be beautified in the new desktop version, to come.
